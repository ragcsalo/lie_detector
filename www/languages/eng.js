txt_leir1_html = '<b style="font-size:15pt">Random mode:</b><br><br>When using Lie Detector, you can always tell if the next result will be a <b class="lie">LIE</b> or <b class="true">TRUE</b>. Look at the bottom left corner: if you see the <b>black dot</b>, the next answer will be a lie. If the corner is empty, the next answer will be true.<br><br><img src="img/secret.png" style="width:100%" border="0" alt=""><br><br>Results alternate at random, with one exception: after two of the same results in a row always comes the opposite (lie -> lie -> <b>true</b> and true -> true -> <b>lie</b>), so sometimes you know the next result even without looking at the corner.<br><br>Knowing the next result you can give the right words to the spectator\'s mouth. For example: if the next result will be a lie, and your spectator took a red card, you say to them: "<i><b>Now say: I have a black card!</b></i>" - and that will be a lie indeed.<br><br><br><b style="font-size:15pt">Random mode + switch:</b><br><br>In the PRO settings you can enable the option <b>Switch with volume buttons</b>, which means you can switch between <b class="lie">LIE</b> and <b class="true">TRUE</b> with any of the volume buttons of your device. This way you can always control the next result.<br><br>If you want  the next result to be true, and you see the black dot in the corner (which means the next result would be a lie), just push the volume button, and the black dot will disappear (so the next result will be true). You have time to switch the result while the detector is still scanning. You can set the scanning duration in the Basic settings.<br><br>Besides the volume buttons, you can also use a Bluetooth remote shutter, or simply just tilting the device to switch the next result (see section <b>PRO settings</b> in the User Guide).<br><br><br><b style="font-size:15pt">Always true + switch:</b><br><br>In the PRO settings you can also enable the option <b>Always TRUE by default</b>, which means each and every result will be <b class="true">TRUE</b>, unless you switch to lie with the volume buttons. This is a very convenient way of controlling the next result: you should switch the result only if the spectator tells a <b class="lie">LIE</b>. You don\'t have to look at the corner because you know the next result will be true by default. It is recommended to set the <b>Duration of scanning</b> to 3-5 seconds and turn the option <b>Show scanning progress</b> ON, so you know how much time you have to switch the result if needed.';

As soon as the spectator removes their finger from the screen, the handle returns to the middle.<br><br>Depending on which mode you are using (see previous section) you either secretly switch the next result or tell the spectator exactly what to say.

txt_leir3_html = 'The spectator should select a card, and somehow you have to find out what that card is. You can either <b>force</b> a card, use a <b>control</b> and a <b>peek</b>, use a <b>marked deck</b> or use a <b>stacked deck</b> (if you are a magician, you must be familiar with these terms).<br><br>My favourite method is using a stacked deck: I spread the deck, the spectator takes one card. Then I cut the deck wherever they took out the card from. By looking at the bottom card I instantly know their card (it will be the next card in the stack).<br><br>The most popular stack is the <b>Si Stebbins stack</b> (just search it on Google or YouTube): suits alternate in <img src="img/clubs.png" height="15" width="15" border="0" alt=""> <img src="img/hearts.png" height="15" width="15" border="0" alt=""> <img src="img/spades.png" height="15" width="15" border="0" alt=""> <img src="img/diamonds.png" height="15" width="15" border="0" alt=""> order, while values are ascending by <b class="lap">+3</b>.

If you use the volume buttons (or tilting the device) to switch the result, they can say anything, you can control the result anyway.<br><br><br><b style="font-size:15pt">An example of a complete routine:</b><br><br>Let\'s assume that your deck is in the <b>Si Stebbins</b> stack order. You spread the cards face down, and the spectator takes out one card. You cut the deck at the exact position where they took the card from, and complete the cut (so you put all the cards above their card below the rest of the deck). Now you peek the bottom card, which is the <b class="lap">6</b><img src="img/clubs.png" height="15" width="15" border="0" alt="">. The next card in the stack is the <b class="piroslap">9</b><img src="img/hearts.png" height="15" width="15" border="0" alt=""> (this card is held by the spectator).<br><br>You start the Lie Detector in random mode, and you don\'t see anything in the bottom left corner - so the first result will be <b class="true">TRUE</b>. Now you tell the spectator to say: <b><i>My card is a red card!</i></b>, and place their finger on the fingerprint. The result will be true. In the next round you see the black dot in the corner, so the next result will be a <b class="lie">LIE</b>. You tell the spectator to say: <b><i>My card is a picture card!</i></b> - and it will be a lie. Again, you see the black dot in the corner, so the next one will be a <b class="lie">LIE</b> again. Now you tell them to say: <b><i>My card is a diamond!</i></b> - and of course it will be a lie. After two lies in a row always comes a <b class="true">TRUE</b>, so you tell them to say: <b><i>My card is an odd number card!</i></b> - and it will be true. For the last round you don\'t see the dot, so it will be <b class="true">TRUE</b> again. So you tell them to say: <b><i>My card is the nine of hearts!</i></b> - and of course it will be true.<br><br>Trick done! :-)';

When you start Lie Detector, there will be a card setting page where you can touch the suit and the value of the spectator\'s card. As soon as you set the card, the selection page disappears and the Lie Detector starts up. At the end of your routine (just before you\'d reveal the spectator\'s card) turn your phone upside down (facing the ground). Ask the spectator to look into the rear camera of the phone for at least 2 seconds, and concentrate on the chosen card. When you turn your phone back (screen up), the card will slowly fade in after 3 seconds. You can make the card disappear by touching it.<br><br><img src="img/card-eng.png" style="width:100%" border="0" alt=""><br><br>';
